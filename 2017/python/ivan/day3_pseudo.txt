find sqrt and mod of input number
the perfect square completes a square grid, moves to index is at the end of a square is always N - 1
to find from a given number, move backwards along grid position subtracting 1 until you find
"center" position (the grid position DIRECTLY over/under/left/right of the index), then add 1 each
increment until then end.

should only ever have to traverse within 1 increment of a squared number
how do i keep track of when the "center" is found?
	- another matrix
	- center is always some row_size/constant?
